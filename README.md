# Francisco Jose Nardi Filho - Personal Resume

Welcome to my personal resume website, hosted at [francisnardi.github.io](https://francisnardi.github.io). This site showcases my professional journey as a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Leader with over 8 years of experience, specializing in financial systems, back-end development, and cloud infrastructure.

## About Me
I’m a dedicated software engineer with a passion for building scalable, high-impact solutions and leading technical teams. My expertise includes Python, C#, Go, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), DevOps practices, and workflow orchestration with tools like Airflow. I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from IFSULDEMINAS and UNICAMP, respectively, and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at UNICAMP, focusing on adaptive systems and data science.
