# Francisco Jose Nardi Filho - Personal Resume

Welcome to my personal resume website, hosted at [francisnardi.github.io](https://francisnardi.github.io). This site serves as a showcase of my professional journey as a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Leader with over 8 years of experience, specializing in financial systems, back-end development, and cloud infrastructure.

## About Me
I’m a passionate software engineer with a strong background in designing scalable solutions, leading technical teams, and delivering data-driven innovations, particularly in the financial domain. My expertise spans Python, C#, Go, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), DevOps practices, and workflow orchestration with tools like Airflow. I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from IFSULDEMINAS and UNICAMP, respectively, and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at UNICAMP, focusing on adaptive systems and data science.

## What You'll Find Here
This repository hosts my resume site, featuring:
- **Professional Experience**: Roles at companies like Sinqia, Yubico, and Itaú Unibanco, highlighting my work in financial systems, APIs, and DevOps.
- **Education**: Academic background, including an exchange program at UMKC (USA).
- **Hackathons & Awards**: Achievements in events like ANBIMA, QuintoAndar, and Algar Telecom Hackathons (1st Place wins).
- **Skills**: Proficiency in Python, cloud infrastructure, risk management, and more.
- **Publications**: Research contributions in data science and adaptive systems.
- **Certificates**: Certifications such as ANBIMA CPA-20 and Professional Scrum Product Owner I.

## How It Works
The site is currently a static HTML page (`index.html`) with embedded styles and Bootstrap for responsiveness. It’s designed to be lightweight and easily deployable via GitHub Pages. While a `_config.yml` file is included for potential future use with Jekyll, the current implementation is fully self-contained in `index.html`.
